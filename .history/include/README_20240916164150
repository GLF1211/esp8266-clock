This directory is intended for project header files.

A header fs::File is a fs::File containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header fs::File in your project source fs::File (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header fs::File produces the same results as copying the header fs::File
into each source fs::File that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header fs::File, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header fs::File will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header fs::File eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.
It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and underscores in
header fs::File names, and at most one dot.
